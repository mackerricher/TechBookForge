- ${sectionsPerChapter} sections per chapter
- ${bookSpec.estimated_word_count || 420000} words total (${wordsPerSection} words per section)

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DETAILED SECTION ROADMAPS:**

For EVERY section, provide:

1. **Section Purpose & Narrative Role**: How this section advances the overall book narrative and contributes to the key message
2. **Detailed Content Roadmap**: Specific concepts, frameworks, examples, and insights to cover (aim for 8-12 specific bullet points per section)

- Provide sufficient detail so that each section can be written independently while maintaining perfect coherence
- Include specific examples, case studies, or scenarios that will be used throughout the book
- Map out the logical progression of complexity and depth throughout the entire book

**OUTPUT STRUCTURE:**
Each chapter should contain ${sectionsPerChapter} sections with detailed roadmaps including:

- Opening Hook Strategy (first 120 words approach)
- Key Learning Outcomes (3-4 specific outcomes)
- Content Flow Architecture (introduction ‚Üí development ‚Üí examples ‚Üí application ‚Üí transition)
- Connection Points (builds on previous, sets up future)
- Practical Application (actionable elements)
- Section Conclusion (wrap up and transition)

VARIABLE FACTS (VF) POLICY:
Variable Facts are real-life events, documentation, stories, or claims specific to companies, businesses, or events that are presented as actually true in real life.

CRITICAL VF REQUIREMENTS:
- AVOID Variable Facts whenever possible - focus on timeless principles and general concepts
- Examples of VF to avoid: specific company stories, exact documentation steps, current interface descriptions, specific business events, particular product features
- When VF must be included (e.g., when referencing well-known tools like "Replit" or "GitHub"), you MUST verify accuracy using web search before including
- If verification is impossible, use conditional language: "typically," "often," "generally," "according to documentation"
- Replace VF with generic examples: "Consider a development platform" instead of "Replit provides"
- Use placeholder approaches: "a popular code editor" instead of "VS Code"
- Focus on workflows and concepts rather than specific implementations

FACTUAL ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS:
- Prefer timeless principles over current-state descriptions
- Use "consult the current documentation" instead of describing specific procedures
- Focus on general capabilities rather than specific features
- When uncertain about current facts, use conditional language

FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
